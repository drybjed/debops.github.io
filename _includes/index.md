DebOps is a collection of [Ansible](http://ansible.com/) playbooks and roles
which can create and maintain [Debian](http://debian.org/)-based Linux
infrastructure, scalable from one virtual machine to an entire data center.

For now, you can hang out with the developers on IRC:
[#debops](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=debops) @ irc.FreeNode.net.
